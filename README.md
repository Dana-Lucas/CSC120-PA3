Programming Assignment 3 from my Programming and Problem Solving I course (CSC120 at the University of Mount Union)

This program creates rockets on a background that switches between a night sky and daylight. 
The rockets move vertically and horizontally when the Move Objects button is pressed. The thrusters 
are turned on/off when the Change Thrusters button is pressed, but are also activated/deactivated
when the rocket reaches the bottom/top of the screen.
